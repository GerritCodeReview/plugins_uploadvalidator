      "message": "So the implementation of inheritance can be done in different ways.  For this implementation the parameters are not combined.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n  --- All-Project ---\n   [plugin \"uploadvalidator\"]\n      blockedFileExtension \u003d jar\n\n\n  --- child project ----\n   [plugin \"uploadvalidator\"]\n      blockedFileExtension \u003d zip\n\n\nThe only file that is blocked is zip, *not* jar.  If you want both blocked then you need to define all blocked file types in the child project, like so:\n\n\n  --- child project ----\n   [plugin \"uploadvalidator\"]\n      blockedFileExtension \u003d jar\n      blockedFileExtension \u003d zip",

      "message": "I\u0027m a bit confused by the word \"combine\" because i take it to mean that the parameters of child projects are merged with parent.  Is that wrong?\n\n\nWhen I implemented this change I thought the correct thing to do for this specific plugin is to allow child projects to \"override\" parent parameters.   If you feel that combined/merged is the better approach then I\u0027m fine with that as well.  I think in this case the combined approach makes configuration more confusing especially when you have multiple levels of heirarchy.",
