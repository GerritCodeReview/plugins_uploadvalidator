This plugin allows to configure upload validations per project.

Project owners can configure:

 - blocked file extensions
 - invalid filenames
 - invalid line endings
 - symbolic links
 - required footers
 - maximum allowed path length

Pushes of commits that violate these settings are rejected by Gerrit.
