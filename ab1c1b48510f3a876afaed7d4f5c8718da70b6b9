We are going through some hops internally because Tika doesn\u0027t work on our infrastructure and this change adds additional burden, because it introduced a failing state in the repo.\n\nYou could add the test with a correct assertation that passes and shows the wrong behavior and a TODO(name) to fix this. The Tika change could have then removed the TODO(name) and corrected the assertation.",
