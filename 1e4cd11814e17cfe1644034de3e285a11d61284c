      "message": "Hmm, I think this may lead to some confusion.\nThe plugin exposes it\u0027s configuration parameters on the project screen in the UI and project owners can change the configuration there.\nIf you disable the plugin for some projects by setting this in a parent project. The plugin configuration parameters will still be exposed on projects for which the plugin is disabled, wouldn\u0027t they? So a project owner who is not aware that the plugin was disabled for his project, may change the plugin configuration and then be confused why nothing works.",

      "message": "If they can see the plugin configuration, they\u0027d also be able to see \"project \u003d .*regexhere.*\", won\u0027t they?\n\nIt seems similar in concept to \"ref \u003d .*insertregexhere.*\". That would only apply to a subset of branches, so a project owner who isn\u0027t aware it\u0027s disabled for his or her ref may change the plugin configuration and then be confused why nothing works.\n\nIt seems like it would be the responsibility of the person changes it to be aware of all the options that might affect their change (i.e. ref, project, all the skip options, etc.)",
