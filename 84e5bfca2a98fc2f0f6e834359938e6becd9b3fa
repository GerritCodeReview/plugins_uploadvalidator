It\u0027s possible that my opinions are colored by the fact that when I installed the plugin, people were encountering this due to errors completely unrelated to actually blocking keywords.\n\nPeople were attempting to cherry-pick and getting an IOException due to the commit not being visible, which had nothing to do with checking blocked keywords.",
