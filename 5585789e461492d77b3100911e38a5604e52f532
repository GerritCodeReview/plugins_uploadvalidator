Our first goal was simply a global config to disable checks for a Gerrit group ... and we are now talking about refactoring the configuration file :-)\n\nAll good, but it is now a different scope :-)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e How can you achieve in the example above, the differentiation on\n \u003e the disabling of checks for two groups:\n \u003e \n \u003e * ldap/ReleaseManagers\n \u003e * ldap/GerritAdmins\n \u003e \n \u003e for two different projects:\n \u003e \n \u003e * foo\n \u003e * bar\n\nIt isn\u0027t currently possible with the plugin to target different configuration on a per-branch basis.\n\nIt\u0027s all good, but it\u0027s a different change IMHO.\n\n \u003e \n \u003e for two different validation kinds:\n \u003e \n \u003e * blockedFileExtension\n \u003e * blockedContentType\n \u003e \n \u003e for two different branches:\n \u003e \n \u003e * foo-stable-42\n \u003e * bar-stable-42\n \u003e \n \u003e etc. like two different directories...\n \u003e \n \u003e That why you need to move the plugin disabling configuration in its\n \u003e own config file to not have to use [plugin \"@PLUGIN@\"], and to be\n \u003e able to say that:\n \u003e \n \u003e [filter \"project:foo branch:foo-stable-42\"]\n \u003e commiter \u003d ldap/ReleaseManagers\n \u003e disable \u003d blockedFileExtension\n \u003e \n \u003e [filter \"project:bar branch:bar-stable-42\"]\n \u003e commiter \u003d ldap/GerritAdmins\n \u003e disable \u003d blockedContentType\n\nYes, agreed and like it.\n\n@Sa≈°a what do you think?",
