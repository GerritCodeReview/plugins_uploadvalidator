      "message": "We had a different idea on implementing the override logic, just that no one started working on it yet.\n\nThe idea was to use Git notes on a dedicated notes branch, to manage override for particular commits. One note is an override permission for one commit.\n\nAssume the dedicated notes branch is named refs/notes/uploadvalidator/override, a developer needs to push a commit with SHA1\u003dc0ffee.. and that commit doesn\u0027t pass the uploadvalidator validations. In that case a project lead, one who has\npermissions to push to the refs/notes/uploadvalidator/*, creates\na note on the c0ffee SHA1 (in the note content he may write the reason\nfor approving the exception) and pushes that note to Gerrit.\n\nThe uploadvalidator plugin first checks existence of a override note for the received commit. If such a note is present it skips all validations.\n\nThis approach has some advantages:\n* all exceptions are well documented and we also know who created them\n* no need for a new access permission. We use the Push permission on the refs/notes/uploadvalidator/override to control who can approve overrides\n\nWhat do you think?",
