I created 2 different issues upstream for exact that problem: [1], [2].\n\nSo the way to go for now, is to provide complete standalone build for now, based on bazlets. The advantage here is, we do not need to add bazlets as a git submodule as it was the the case with bucklets. In addition we are adding a part of WORKSPACE in own file and called it WORKSPACE.in_gerrit_tree: [3]. \n\n* [1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2224\n* [2] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2391\n* [3] https://github.com/davido/gerrit-oauth-provider/blob/master/WORKSPACE.in_gerrit_tree",
